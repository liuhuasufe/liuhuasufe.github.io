I am currently an assistant professor in [School of Economics and Finance](http://sef.xjtu.edu.cn/index.htm) at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I got my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from [School of Statistics and Management, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Jinhong You](https://ssm.sufe.edu.cn/f7/82/c712a128898/page.htm). During 2019-2021, I worked as a visiting Ph.D student in [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) with [Prof. Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/). My research interests are mainly on functional data analysis and non/semiparametric modeling.
